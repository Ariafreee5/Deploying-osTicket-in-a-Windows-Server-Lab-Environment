# Deploying-osTicket-in-a-Windows-Server-Lab-Environment
üìù Project Summary

This project is a tutorial walkthrough demonstrating the full deployment and configuration of osTicket, an open-source support ticketing system, within a simulated IT infrastructure using virtual machines.

It replicates a small enterprise environment, showcasing key IT skills including domain controller setup, user/group management, LAMP stack deployment, and internal web access from client machines.

 Languages Used:

PowerShell (for automation and user account creation)

Basic command line / Bash scripting (for Linux setup)

 Environments Used:

Windows Server 2019 (Domain Controller, DNS)

Windows 10 (Client Machine)

Ubuntu 20.04 (Web Server)

Hyper-V (Virtualization)

 Technologies / Applications / Services:

osTicket (Support Ticket System)

Apache, MySQL, PHP (LAMP stack)

Active Directory Domain Services

Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)

Windows DNS Server

GitHub (Documentation repository)

 Demonstration

This section walks through each step of the project implementation in detail.

 Step 1: Set Up the Domain Controller (Windows Server 2019)

Configure a static IP

Rename the server and install Active Directory Domain Services

Promote to Domain Controller

Set up internal domain: corp.local

Create test user accounts in Active Directory

 Step 2: Set Up Ubuntu Web Server (Ubuntu 20.04)

Install Ubuntu on Hyper-V VM

Install Apache: sudo apt install apache2

Install MySQL: sudo apt install mysql-server

Install PHP and dependencies:
sudo apt install php libapache2-mod-php php-mysql php-imap php-intl php-gd php-curl php-mbstring php-xml php-cli unzip

Restart services and configure firewall:

sudo systemctl restart apache2
sudo ufw allow 80

 Step 3: Download and Install osTicket

Download osTicket from official site

Unzip and move to /var/www/html/

Create MySQL database and user

Run web-based setup at http://<ubuntu-ip>/upload

Step 4: Connect Windows 10 Client to the Domain

Join the client to the domain corp.local

Log in with test AD account

Open browser and navigate to osTicket web server

Create a new support ticket

 Step 5: Ticket Handling

Admin logs into the osTicket dashboard

Views the ticket, assigns agent, replies

Demonstrates full ticket lifecycle

 Conclusion

This project demonstrates the following core IT skills:

Server configuration and domain management

LAMP stack and application hosting

Cross-platform networking (Windows ‚Üî Linux)

User role simulation (End-user vs IT Support)

It also shows real-world implementation of a help desk system that employers often use, such as osTicket, ServiceNow, or Freshdesk.
